# SUXIOS Project State Vault

Updated: 2026-06-03 Asia/Shanghai

## Current Verified State

- Main repo root: `HOTEL/`.
- Current branch observed this run: `codex/save-project-20260531`.
- Current worktree is dirty: `package.json`, `public/index.html`, and `public/style.css` are modified; `scripts/verify_taste_page_coverage.mjs` and `scripts/verify_taste_visual_smoke.mjs` are untracked.
- Main product chain: OTA data from Ctrip/Meituan -> revenue analysis -> AI decisions -> operations management -> investment decisions.
- Current priority skill focus: Ctrip response -> field -> table closure.

## Gate State

- Functional acceptance and release readiness are separate states.
- Existing reports show functional acceptance can pass while release readiness remains blocked by production env, LLM attestation, design handoff, OTA credential cleanup/attestation, formal security scan, and local/PR state.
- Do not claim release readiness until the release gates pass with real evidence files, not placeholders.

## Ctrip Field Closure State

- Recent Ctrip work moved beyond pure login blocking into captured endpoint evidence, response-only endpoints, gap lists, field selection, and table planning.
- Remaining Ctrip gaps must stay explicit; do not replace missing values with `0` or fallback success.
- Every field must keep Ctrip OTA channel scope unless whole-hotel source evidence exists.

## Maintenance Rule

Update this vault after important context changes, save-project runs, new release evidence, or completed field/table closure work. Record only verified facts and avoid secrets, raw cookies, raw tokens, account data, phone numbers, screenshots with sensitive OTA data, or large raw capture JSON.
